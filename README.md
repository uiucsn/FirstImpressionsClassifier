# PHotometric Analysis Software Tools (PHAST)
Welcome! This package contains a set of simple, rapid, and easily-interpretable software tools for studying transient events using their observed photometry. With this software, you can 
1. Associate a transient with its most likely host-galaxy (modified from astro_ghost). 

2. Predict the most-likely class of the transient (using a quick and simple RNN), either without host-galaxy information.

3. Get the most likely redshift of the host-galaxy using normalizing flows (thanks to John Franklin Crenshaw's PZFlow package). 

and more! See the startup doc tutorial.ipynb to get started. If you have any questions, please reach out to me at _gaglian2@illinois.edu_. 

Note: PHAST can do none of these things yet.
